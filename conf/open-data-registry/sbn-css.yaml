Name: Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) subset data on AWS
Description: This subset of the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) bundle contains raw image data generated by the survey. CSS has used multiple telescopes in Arizona and Australia to discover and follow-up Near Earth Objects (NEOs). NEOs are asteroids and comets that can approach the Earth. The survey continues to be conducted using telescopes and cameras on Mount Lemmon and Mount Bigelow in the Santa Catalina Mountains of the Coronado National Forest near Tucson, Arizona.
